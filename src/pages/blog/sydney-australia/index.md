We spent a week in Sydney with Ben & Buffy and their kids Lulu & Alexander.
Sydney is an amazing city! After a few hours there I turned and said to Abe “So how does one go about moving to a different country for no good reason?”
There is so much to do and see, we barely scratched the surface.
Unfortunately Stella was sick our week there, so that made for an even slower pace...
