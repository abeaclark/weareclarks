The whole crew went up to Halewia to try to get some surfing in.
We met up later with everyone to let Abe finish working.
It was pretty stormy and we were all standing under a building close to the beach.
But it started to clear up and we all went out to the beach again! Abe hopped in to help Sabrina surf and she did awesome! After that Cassidy went in and then after a lot of convincing I got in to try it out.
I was not interested in the getting in the water because I was COLD and also because there was coral underneath the waves at this particular spot which made me nervous to surf AKA just fall off the board.
