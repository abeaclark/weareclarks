The rice terraces in Bali are one of my favorite things (if not my actual favorite). We saw SO many everywhere we drove with our host Ayu. We would drive past some small ones every time we'd head back to the Airbnb. The most notable ones are the Tegallalang Rice Terraces and the Jatiluwih Rice Terraces. The Tegallalang ones are absolutely stunning. When we went the rice had just been harvested, so it was mostly brown. But the curves in the hillside are just breathtaking to look at. Definitely worth visiting. These rice terraces you can see from one side or the other, but there's not much walking and you just look at the view and take pictures. The other rice terraces we visited are called Jatiluwih. And these have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it isn't hard to see why. These go one for what seems like forever in every direction you look. Jatiluwih is its own town, so when you enter you pay a small entrance fee. I really liked these rice terraces because there is actually a walking path you can walk around and through a lot of the terraces and meet local farmers. We met a lot of cows which Stella loved! The rice terraces here hadn't recently been harvested and so it was green green green. Make sure you visit both of these rice terraces if you ever visit Bali! If you only have time to visit one then I'd suggest Jatiluwih hands down.

Thanks for reading!
