Budapest didn’t make our original itinerary. But, everyone we talked to who had explored Europe listed Budapest a a clear favorite. So, we booked our RyanAir tickets to spend a few days in Hungary. I’m glad we did!

Budapest follows the same layout as most other famous European cities. A lazy river at the center, scattered bridges connecting the banks, and cross-wielding spires on each horizon.

But, there was something unique about this one. Maybe it was the expansive, seemingly untouched old town with rows of 4 story Art Nouveau buildings. Maybe it was the Hungarian motifs coloring rooftops around town. Maybe it was the Goulash soup (or Strawberry Soup!) at the old-school grandma’s style Hungarian restaurant. Or maybe it was the haunting sculpted shoes looking out over the Danube river where their symbolic owners met their deaths. Something about it was impressive and exciting.

A few of our highlights were:

**Fisherman's Bastion and Matthias Church** — we walked up the hill and got a great view of the city from the top.

**The Parliament Building** — one of the most impressive architectural beauties of the city. It’s sheer size is impressive, especially when viewed from the opposite river bank.

**Shoes on the Danube** — these shoes commemorate the thousands who were brutally shot and pushed into the river during the holocaust. They were asked to remove their shoes first because shoes were valuable.

**Central Market** — the market was a fantastic refuge on a rainy day. We found lots of paprika, ingredients for Goulash soup, and some impressive (and expensive) hand-carved Santa statuettes.

**Széchenyi Baths** — a complex of heated baths both indoor and outdoor. The kids loved swimming here and the adults did too. The architecture made you feel like you were in an old Roman bath.

Thanks for reading,

Abe
