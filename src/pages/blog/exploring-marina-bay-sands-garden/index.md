### Flower Dome + Cloud Dome

We headed over to the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands area to explore. This area feels huge and there must be so much there to explore! We had planned to go to this children’s park/splash pad in the Gardens by the Bay, but it turned out that they are closed on Mondays. We ended up buying tickets to go to in the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome. We weren’t totally sure what these were, but they looked really cool and we needed something to do!

We are so glad we visited both of these places! First of all we were surprised when we walked into the flower dome and the temperature was chilly. I figured it would be similar to the temperature outside or like a greenhouse. But it was refreshingly chilly which was an amazing perk. Inside there are all these different gardens and currently they had a cherry blossom exhibit going on. Stella really enjoyed running around the trees and seeing the different flowers. 

The Cloud Dome was also really really fun to see! This exhibit had a bunch of plants and greenery everywhere. But the amazing thing was the man-made waterfall right as you enter the exhibit! It was so interesting to see and really quite impressive. They also had it set up so you could take an elevator up to the top and walk down through the different levels, getting different points of view along the way. I’m finding it hard to describe either of these exhibits, but we were pleasantly surprised and so glad we came! Hopefully the pictures below can explain more of our experience at the Flower Dome and Cloud Dome!

We also took some time to walk along the waterfront and see the skyline view. Marina Bay Sands hotel is seriously impressive, and we are excited to stay in that hotel tonight!

Thanks for reading!
