We spent 3 weeks in Bavaria at Zach and Jenn’s house. It was a grand time. We took some multi-day trips to countries a few hours away and also did day trips to cities nearby.

The highlight was being with family. Stella and Jackson played for hours each day, we made lots of cookies, and Jenn (Zach was gone for work) was an incredible host.

### Velburg

Velburg is a tiny town, but has a lot of beauty. It’s surrounded by fields of vibrant yellow flowers. The downtown area (about 1 city block) maintains classic Bavarian architecture. There are two bakeries and a butcher in the town square. Up the hill there is a beautiful, quaint church that is older than the United States. On top of the hill are ruins of the old town castle. 

Stella and Jackson dressed up in traditional German clothing (Dirndl and Lederhosen) and had a photo shoot just outside town in the flower fields. You can’t get much cuter than these photos.

### Regensburg

Regensburg was about 30 minutes away. Well, I should clarify, it was 30 minutes away driving 115 mph on the Autobahn. Going that fast didnt feel scary here though. It felt very normal because the roads were well maintained and drivers were religious about getting over to the slow lane except when passing. I could get used to this way of driving. 

The highlight of Regensburg was the sausages. There is a tiny, stone sausage shop along the river that has been there for centuries. They still make the sausages in the little shop and serve them with sauerkraut and their famous sweet mustard. These were amazing. I think one important factor is that they were the thickness of your finger. I feel like Johnsonville has corrupted my understanding of bratwursts with their massive, thick dogs. Thin is where it’s at.

Thanks for reading,
