This is the first activity we did once we arrived in Hawaii! We headed to this trail after church on Sunday.
It is a nice paved path, stroller friendly, and has great views!
Parking can be crowded but there are always people coming and going so we all got parking spots pretty quickly.
Although this is a paved trail and doesn’t feel as much like a “hike,” there is some decent elevation gain and steady upward climb the entire way up.
We really enjoyed doing this hike with Buffy & Ben and their two kids Lulu & Alexander. 

Thanks for reading!
