### Infinity pool + ridiculous hotel robes + tree garden light show.

Have you ever relaxed on a rooftop balcony? What about a rooftop pool? What about a rooftop infinity pool spanning 3 skyscrapers on the 57th floor overlooking all of Singapore? Yeah...neither had I.

That’s why when I started researching Singapore, I knew we HAD to stay 1 night at the Marina Bay Sands. And, I’m SO glad we did. The price tag of ~$450/night was painful (Luckily they eased me into it advertising $300/night, then charging for a better view, then adding on another ~$100 in taxes… nice upsell, guys). We chalked it up to our anniversary and to be honest, I would pay it again in a heartbeat. This was the highlight of Singapore for me and a contender for the highlight of Asia so far.

What makes Marina Bay Sands so great? 

You’re sitting directly across the small bay from all of Singapore, so the view is incredible. We paid for the city view and loved being able to see the skyline from our room. 

The hotel towers are built adjacent to a super high-class mall with every luxury brand (not that we shopped those brands) and some great food (we had chicken and waffles that were amazing!). The entire campus is chic and beautiful. It made me feel a little out of place in my Chacos and North Face shorts, but luckily I just don’t care.

On the garden side of the hotel is an expansive, immaculate park with two enormous glass domes that house the flower exhibit and cloud exhibit as well as a grouping of “supertrees” that reach many stories up and are illuminated by all sorts of lights. At night they have a free show where they set the tree lights to music. It was a great show, Stella loved it!

The best part for me, of course, was putting on my robe and slippers, taking the lift to floor 57 and relaxing poolside while looking out over the city. It’s really phenomenal. I’ll probably never be satisfied by another hotel pool in my life.

If you go to Singapore (and you have a budget) use it on Marina Bay Sands for at least 1 night, you won’t regret it!

Thanks for reading,

Abe
